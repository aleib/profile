Neon overview:
I co-built Neon, a collaborative, visual analytics tool that makes data exploration accessible: users drag datasets (CSV, BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.) onto a shared canvas, create interactive charts, and link related tables automatically. Neon combines a familiar table/SQL abstraction for power users with an approachable, highly interactive UI that supports annotation, filtering and rapid ad-hoc analysis.
