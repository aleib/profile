Coauthor overview:
Built by Hunch (@hunchtools), Coauthor was first introduced as a tool to help craft 2024 LinkedIn Rewinds, which exceeded 300,000 users.

Share your thoughts via voice note or text, and we'll craft posts in your authentic voice. The best ideas don't come from PR firms or AI content farms. They come from people building things and doing things that matter – founders, executives, experts, and professionals like you with real insights to share.

But you're busy. You don't have hours to craft engaging posts. And you won't compromise your voice with generic AI content or $3,000/month agencies.

That's why we built Coauthor:

1. We get to know you deeply – your experiences, insights, and how you naturally communicate
2. You share thoughts via voice interview or quick text notes (no prompting)
3. We craft LinkedIn posts that sound authentically like you – more platforms coming soon
4. You build real influence while focusing on what matters

Why This Matters
The internet promised direct access to any audience. But between LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Substack, BlueSky, TikTok, and YouTube there are more platforms than ever, and a flood of generic AI-generated noise. The solution isn't more polish or better algorithms. It's you – your unique perspective, your real experiences, your authentic voice.

That's the essence of "going direct" - speaking directly to the people who matter. Building your own audience. Owning your narrative.

Coauthor helps you do exactly that, without the time investment traditional content creation requires.

We're accepting a limited number of users in January 2025. Sign up for early access now.
