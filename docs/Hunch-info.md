Here are two CV-ready options — a short blurb (1 line) and a slightly longer paragraph + bullets you can drop into a resume or LinkedIn. I kept them factual and direct.

Short (one line)
Founder & CEO — Hunch: built an AI-first workspace that unifies top large-language and multimodal models with reusable templates and automated workflows to help teams run large-scale AI tasks and ship production tools. ([hunch.tools][1])

Expanded (1 short paragraph + 3 bullets)
Hunch is an AI-first workspace for teams that combines model orchestration, structured templates, and execution primitives (batch runs, web scraping, and embedded code execution) to automate complex research, writing, and product workflows. I led product and engineering efforts to design the core canvas, templates and tooling that enable teams to create reusable AI tools and run thousands of tasks in parallel. ([hunch.tools][1])

• Built a template-driven workspace and toolchain that lets teams prompt, compare, and orchestrate multiple top AI models for real work (writing, research, product, and engineering workflows). ([hunch.tools][1])
• Engineered execution features (batch processing, web scraping, run-code integrations) to scale AI workflows from single prompts to thousands of parallel tasks. ([hunch.tools][1])
• Delivered enterprise hygiene and compliance progress (SOC2 Type 1 in progress), enabling safer team adoption and integrations. ([hunch.tools][1])

Product note (from internal launch history you provided)
• Hunch shipped Coauthor — a social-posting assistant that converted voice or text into authentic LinkedIn posts and powered the 2024 LinkedIn Rewind experience (300k+ users). (internal)

If you want, I can tighten either into a single 20–25 word sentence for a CV header or convert the expanded version into 2–3 punchy resume bullets optimized for hiring managers. Which format do you prefer?
