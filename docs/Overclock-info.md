Below are a few clean output formats you can drop into a CV or LinkedIn.

## **One-liner for CV**

AI-powered content platform helping founders and executives create authentic LinkedIn posts from short voice or text inputs—preserving personal tone without agencies or generic AI.

## **Short 2–3 sentence overview**

Coauthor is an AI-driven writing product that turns founders’ and executives’ raw thoughts—shared by voice note or short text—into polished LinkedIn posts that match their real communication style. The system learns a user’s tone, experiences, and patterns, so content sounds personal rather than manufactured, eliminating the need for ghostwriters or expensive content agencies. It enables busy operators to build audience, influence, and narrative ownership with minimal time investment.

## **Compact product paragraph**

Coauthor was originally launched to power 2024 LinkedIn Rewinds, which attracted more than 300,000 users. It now functions as a lightweight “voice-to-audience” engine: users speak or jot notes, the platform extrapolates their linguistic fingerprint, and it drafts social content that reflects genuine expertise. The mission is direct distribution—helping builders cut through generic AI noise, grow reach across platforms, and communicate without surrendering authenticity or hours of weekly writing.

## **Key bullets you can list under your role**

- Product: AI assistant for founder-led content creation and audience building.
- Origin: launched for LinkedIn Rewind 2024 (300k+ users); evolved into ongoing platform.
- Core workflow: user voice/text → model learns voice → delivers authentic social posts.
- Value proposition: eliminate ghostwriting overhead; preserve tone; scale presence across platforms; “go direct” without time cost.
- Target users: founders, executives, operators, domain experts.

If you want it tailored to **Senior Frontend Engineer**, **Founder**, or **Product** positioning, tell me which audience you’re optimising for and I’ll shape the language accordingly.
