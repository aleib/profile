Here are three CV-ready excerpts (short → medium → extended). Use whichever fits your resume or LinkedIn.

Short (one line)

Co-built the frontend of Neon, a fast, visual drag-and-drop data-analysis platform that connects to CSVs, BigQuery, Snowflake and other sources to create interactive charts, automatic joins and collaborative annotated analyses.

Medium (CV bullet — 2 lines)

Co-developed the frontend for Neon, a visual data-analysis canvas that lets non-technical and power users explore data via drag-and-drop charts, automatic schema/typing rules, and seamless dataset linking (no manual joins).

Implemented highly interactive, real-time visualizations and UX patterns that surface distributions, time series and cross-dataset insights while preserving SQL access for power users.

Extended (LinkedIn / profile blurb — 2–3 sentences)

I co-built the frontend for Neon, a collaborative, visual analytics tool that makes data exploration accessible: users drag datasets (CSV, BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.) onto a shared canvas, create interactive charts, and link related tables automatically. Neon combines a familiar table/SQL abstraction for power users with an approachable, highly interactive UI that supports annotation, filtering and rapid ad-hoc analysis.

Want one tailored to a specific job description (e.g., product/frontend engineer, data-viz emphasis, or technical lead)? I’ll adapt any of the above.
